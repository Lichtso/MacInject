MacInject
=========

Command line tool and library to inject and execute program code in another process.  
It is easy to use and does not require deep knowledge like [mach_inject](https://github.com/rentzsch/mach_inject) asserts.  
Just compile a piece of code you want to inject as shared lib and call the MacInjectTool with super user rights.
